# Tomb of Horrors (Under Construction)

This is a set of Fan maps created for the Tomb of Horrors (Under Construction)

All maps are set as "public" and available in [DungeonFog](https://www.dungeonfog.com/platform/public-maps/)
- This mod's version of Flesh Golem Laboratories was created using assets from
  [Forgotten Adventures](www.forgotten-adventures.net)
	- I do not have permission to redistribute assets from Forgotten Adventures
	- Therefore the public DungeonFog version does not have those assets.

These maps can enhance your experience when used with Mr. Primate's [DDB
Adventure Muncher](https://github.com/MrPrimate/ddb-adventure-muncher) and [DDB
Importer](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ddb-importer/).
